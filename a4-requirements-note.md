This project actually fails to meet several of the requirements of a4.
	- Not based on another visualization; does not load a dataset
	- The maps are sort of linked in that they are all updated at once, but they aren't interactive except for tooltips. Interaction is handled through the sliders at the top.
	- No brushing
